# <Prework Study Guide Webpage>

## This is a guide to help me organize what the Bootcamp will teach me. This guide will help me better understand and will also be used as a cheat-sheet if I forget or I need a refresher about certain topics. This guide has helped me put my thoughts in an organized site rather than having to fit a lot of information in my brain.
